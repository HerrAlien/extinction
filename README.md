# Extinction-O-Meter #
* The repo is for an utility that can apply corrections for differential extinction on visual brightness estimates of variable stars. It can even determine the extinction coefficient, using the procedure described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18RcrzoP0-Xy8_-xsWbnwWAj2m1lAL5WrHUm5S-Neu7Y/edit?usp=sharing)
* Version: 1.0.3.11

## How do I get set up? ##

* Make sure you're connected to the Internet
* You'll need one of the following browsers: Google Chrome (when going for the chrome app), Internet Explorer 9 (when using the .HTA version), Mozilla Firefox (when installed via Mozilla Marketplace) or Opera 30.0 (when installed as an extension from the Opera ); mobile browsers and Macs will have to use the online app (see last point in this list).
* **For Internet Explorer** fans, download and unpack [the zip file](https://bitbucket.org/herr_alien/extinction-o-meter/downloads/extinction-o-meter-HTA.zip) to your HDD, and double-click the index.hta file to use the application
* **For Chrome, Firefox and Opera** fans, just click the image below for the corresponding app store.

* In the unfortunate event that you're stuck with a **mobile browser (be it on Android, or on iOS) or with a Mac** ... then the only thing I have for you is the [online version](http://extinction-o-meter.appspot.com/); it works, but is a tad slower in fetching maps.
